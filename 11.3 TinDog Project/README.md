#DogTok Project
Developing our understanding of Bootstrap implentation with our HTML to develop a mockup website that is called DogTok. The purpose of DogTok is to develop a social media network for Dogs in your neighborhood to connect and become friends and develop a long relationship with. The interface idea would be similar to TikTok where users can add videos of their dogs and our automated system matches your dog and allows messages with other dogs to connect and create their friendships with. :)

Mockup Design was made with the intention on improving our understanding of grids, columns, and customizing available examples that are found on the Boostrap website https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/.
There were a few SVGs icons that were utilized from the bootstrap website: Apple Logo, etc.
